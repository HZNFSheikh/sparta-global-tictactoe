## My attempt for Tic Tac Toe

For this homework we were tasked with creating a game of tic tac toe using jQuery and HTML, be able to reset the board, have a winner and an alert to show which player one

### MVP that was delivered

From my attempt, the MVP that was delievered allows two players to play a game, but i had trouble with the logic and code in terms of determining a winner when 3 in a row was achieved by a player. The reset board button also was tasked to us to be functioning which i got to work. 

#### Difficulties I experienced and changes I would make

Personally i thought it was a challenging task and I welcome this as it is the only way we can learn. But I feel i may have made the logic for the end game of declaring a winner to complicated. I will ask for feedback in the lesson to help get to the bottom of this and achieve the last deliverable required.
